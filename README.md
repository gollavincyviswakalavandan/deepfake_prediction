# 🎥 Uncertainty-Aware DeepFake Video Detection

## 📌 Overview

This project presents an advanced DeepFake video detection system that combines:

- Frame-level CNN classification
- Monte Carlo Dropout for uncertainty estimation
- Temporal suspicious segment detection
- Grad-CAM explainability for manipulated region localization

The system not only detects whether a video is fake, but also:

✔ Identifies suspicious time segments  
✔ Estimates prediction uncertainty  
✔ Visualizes manipulated regions  

This makes it suitable for forensic and research applications.

## 🧪 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Frame-Level Classification
Each video frame is resized to 224x224 and passed through a CNN model trained for binary classification (Real vs Fake).

### 2️⃣ Monte Carlo Dropout
Multiple forward passes (T=10) are performed to compute:
- Mean prediction probability
- Predictive variance (uncertainty)

### 3️⃣ Temporal Suspicious Detection
Frames exceeding a probability threshold (0.7) are marked as suspicious.
Time segments are calculated using FPS.

### 4️⃣ Grad-CAM Explainability
Grad-CAM is used to highlight manipulated facial regions in suspicious frames.
